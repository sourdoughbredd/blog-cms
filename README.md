# Blog CMS

This project is a React-based content management system (CMS) built with Vite. It includes essential features for managing and displaying blog content efficiently. It was built to showcase the [Blog API](https://github.com/sourdoughbredd/blog-api).

## Description

The Blog CMS is designed to provide a seamless and efficient user experience for managing and interacting with blog posts. It uses React for the frontend framework, Vite for the development environment, and incorporates various modern web development practices. Note that since this was only developed to showcase the [Blog API](https://github.com/sourdoughbredd/blog-api), it isn't the prettiest and may have some UI bugs.
